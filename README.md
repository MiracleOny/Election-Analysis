## Overview of Election Audit
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout

You will be using Python to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis of election results.

## Election-Audit Results 
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% (272,892) of votes
- The largest county turnout was Denver with 82.7% (306,055) of votes

Below is a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county and the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received:

## Election-Audit Summary
In future elections, this script can be used to analyze not only the number and percentages of votes in all counties invovled in an election but which counties had higher turnout rates than others, which counties voted democratic vs republican, and which candidates were in the lead at specific intervals in an election. Using this script will allow analysts to interpret and predict election results.
